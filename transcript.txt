0.00 --> 6.56:  Imagine that you control a drone. The drone looks at that reality where it is,
7.28 --> 14.24:  sends me information and I get the conscious experience of what the drone is seeing.
14.24 --> 18.80:  That conscious experience is not in my body, it's in my consciousness.
20.08 --> 26.16:  A scientific theory that basically states that our body is operated like a drone from a conscious
26.16 --> 30.96:  quantum field, which would mean that experience qualia is not in your head.
30.96 --> 34.16:  The qualia do not exist in the body, they exist in the field.
38.16 --> 41.76:  It is crazy, but it is much closer to the truth.
43.52 --> 49.44:  Federico Foschini invented the first CPU, the touchpad and worked on the first neural nets,
49.44 --> 52.72:  which gave him the hope of creating conscious AI.
52.80 --> 58.96:  Took me 30 years to figure out that mathematics is created by consciousness
59.52 --> 62.88:  and therefore I cannot explain consciousness with mathematics.
62.88 --> 69.68:  People, many physicists think that there is emerging properties in the purely classical world.
69.68 --> 73.76:  It cannot be. Emergentism requires quantumness.
75.84 --> 80.56:  Like some other renowned physicists, Foschini is convinced that consciousness cannot be a
80.56 --> 86.00:  classical phenomenon and has to be quantum. But his theory of quantum consciousness goes
86.00 --> 91.68:  beyond any theories on the table. We have to go way beyond Schrodinger's equation.
91.68 --> 96.48:  We have to go into Dirac's equation, but even beyond that we have to go to quantum fields
97.04 --> 103.36:  and quantum information. Quantum information goes beyond the concepts of quantum fields.
103.36 --> 110.16:  In fact, the only physicist that has been able to show the quantum physics derived from quantum
110.16 --> 117.36:  information is an Italian physicist, Giacomo Marodariano, who showed that you can derive
117.36 --> 121.28:  all the equations of quantum physics from quantum bits.
121.28 --> 126.72:  Federico Foschini reached out to Marodariano and together they published a paper and Federico
126.72 --> 132.96:  wrote this book. If they are right, not only will they have an accurate theory of consciousness,
132.96 --> 136.80:  they will also solve the mystery of the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
137.52 --> 143.28:  Quantum information is the representation of inner experience and the collapse of the wave
143.28 --> 148.16:  function is the representation of my free will. What more do you want?
148.16 --> 152.32:  That's crazy. That's crazy. Let's try and really understand this.
153.28 --> 158.16:  Welcome to the Ascencia Foundation's YouTube channel. Thanks for watching and may I ask you
158.16 --> 164.88:  to like and subscribe as it really helps us to grow our channel. Now this interview was recorded
164.88 --> 171.36:  when Federico visited the Netherlands to present his new book Irreducible. A link to the book
171.36 --> 177.04:  and scientific papers are in the description below. And in his book, Federico describes how a
177.04 --> 183.12:  deeply personal experience led him to start investigating consciousness. Therefore, I found
183.36 --> 188.72:  interesting to start our conversation with this personal experience. Of course, after that we go
188.72 --> 193.52:  into the theory itself. In the chapter marks below you can see the topics we discussed.
194.16 --> 200.16:  Now without further ado, here is Silicon Hero and consciousness pioneer Federico Foschini.
200.16 --> 205.92:  Federico, can you tell us about a pivotal moment in your life, namely the experience you had at Lake
205.92 --> 210.88:  Tsa Ho, where I pronounced that correctly, during your Christmas holidays of 1990?
212.48 --> 219.84:  Yeah, I wasn't happy. And I reached everything that the world says that if you do all this stuff,
219.84 --> 226.80:  you should be happy. And I wasn't. I realized that I was faking being happy because I needed to,
226.80 --> 231.68:  because I was running a company. I had to be enthusiastic and everything else, but I was dying
231.76 --> 240.40:  inside. So what's going on? What's wrong with this picture? And so consciousness then was,
241.68 --> 249.12:  you know, became center stage in my life, understanding that this consciousness somehow
249.12 --> 255.68:  was also connected with feeling, you know, desperate inside. So what's going on? So I
255.76 --> 261.76:  wanted to understand what consciousness is. So that's when, you know, and I wanted to understand
261.76 --> 269.44:  it for my own sake, for not to do something about it, not to monetize, not to make a new technology,
269.44 --> 274.48:  because before it was all about, you know, doing something, you know, and now all of a sudden I
274.48 --> 280.56:  turn my attention inside because of the suffering. And it was in this climate that I had this
280.56 --> 287.12:  extraordinary experience of consciousness. Now I can go to this Tahoe night, you know, in 1990,
287.12 --> 295.12:  during the Christmas holidays, we had a home up in Tahoe, which is a lake Tahoe, it's a beautiful
295.12 --> 305.36:  lake, 2500 meters, and there are mountains and skin is great. And so, you know, one night I woke up
306.00 --> 314.32:  midnight, you know, I was thirsty, went to get a glass of water, and went back to bed, and was just,
314.32 --> 321.12:  you know, just waiting for, you know, go back to sleep, thinking nothing. And all of a sudden,
321.12 --> 327.92:  out of the chest, just, you know, just energy was coming out of my chest, but it was love.
328.64 --> 337.20:  And it was love that was never felt before. It was love that was coming from me. How can love come
337.20 --> 345.04:  from me? I mean, you know, it was unthinkable that love could come from me, you know. And it was
345.04 --> 350.88:  10,000 times more powerful than any love that I felt before. I mean, in fact, I never felt that love
351.68 --> 358.64:  because it was unconditional love. Now I have a name for it. It was love, period. It was, yes,
358.64 --> 364.72:  it was coming from me, but it was love. And it was light, it was a white light scintillating. It was,
364.72 --> 374.00:  you know, like sparkles, you know, and it was coming out. And then it explodes and is everywhere.
374.00 --> 382.16:  But it's everywhere, but my consciousness is there too. So not only my consciousness is within me,
383.04 --> 392.24:  but it's also outside of me. And all of a sudden I realize I am that. So I am the observer and
392.24 --> 399.12:  the observer simultaneously. But I retain my point of view. I retain my identity. I was still the
399.12 --> 408.32:  same kid of five years old or three years old kid that I was then. And so that I am now. So that
408.32 --> 415.52:  identity was so my, the only thing of me that remained was that point of view. And then I realize,
415.52 --> 420.88:  oh my God, this stuff is the stuff of which everything is made. Everything comes from this stuff.
420.88 --> 429.12:  And my body was hard. It was vibrating, you know, like the cells of my body were resonating with
429.12 --> 436.24:  this thing. This, you know, of course the emotions, the feelings was love, joy, and peace. Because
437.44 --> 444.72:  this stuff felt like that's me. I'm at home. This is me. So I'm finally home. This is the,
445.28 --> 451.84:  you know, this is home. But so it was all mixed up. You cannot separate this stuff, you know, love,
451.84 --> 461.52:  joy, and peace. And then the mind was aligned saying this is the stuff of everything is made. So
462.24 --> 469.36:  I'm everything, but also the observer of everything. So I'm a point of view of one
469.52 --> 476.40:  with which one knows itself. And now is the centerpiece of this new theory of consciousness
476.40 --> 484.16:  that we may talk later. Yeah, beautiful. I mean, I was a physicalist. I thought, you know, basically,
484.16 --> 488.88:  you know, materialist because I study physics, you know, and everybody knows them.
489.84 --> 494.56:  Consciousness comes from matter, perhaps we don't know how, but has to come from matter.
494.64 --> 500.56:  Well, else can you come from? So I mean, that was the mindset that I was. So all of a sudden,
500.56 --> 506.64:  how can, you know, no, this is before matter somehow, you know, so this must be the beginning of it.
507.52 --> 512.88:  So, you know, that changed it. And that, you know, that started me in a completely different,
512.88 --> 520.88:  I went orthogonal in terms of my personal development and thinking while I was running synaptics. So
520.96 --> 525.36:  that was fine. But I spent from that point on 30 to 40 percent of my time
526.56 --> 532.16:  trying to understand what happened and studying doing meditation, you know, figuring, you know,
533.12 --> 542.96:  anything that I could understand to understand what happened. But that picture actually is the end
542.96 --> 548.40:  is now I can explain with this new theory of consciousness, I can explain exactly what happened
548.96 --> 559.36:  and exactly why that is correct. Every single one of us is a field that is both the observer,
560.00 --> 568.48:  the observer, and the actor. Every one of us is a field and it doesn't exist. This field does not
568.48 --> 576.08:  exist in space and time. Space time is exist within these fields that we are, is us. So
576.40 --> 583.44:  I mean, this changes the paradigm, right? But we need a change of paradigm because otherwise,
583.44 --> 591.76:  if we are machines like scientism is telling us, we are going to be taken over by the machines,
594.16 --> 601.12:  artificial intelligence that people will control, powerful people will control, and through those
601.12 --> 608.24:  machines they can control us if we don't change our mind of who we are. It will become a sort of
608.24 --> 613.20:  self-fulfilling prophecy. It will become a self-fulfilling prophecy because we have not done the personal
613.20 --> 619.20:  work to understand who we are. And we are now machines. The body is a machine, but it's a machine
619.20 --> 625.52:  that is infinitely more complex than the computers because it is a quantum and classical machine.
625.52 --> 632.32:  It's not a machine like a computer. Just to, you know, it's simple to understand that every cell
632.32 --> 641.28:  of my body is a part whole of the body. What do I mean by that? Every cell of my body has the genome
642.32 --> 651.20:  of the egg that created the entire organism. So every part of my body has the potential knowledge
651.20 --> 661.12:  of the whole. In this case, the whole is just the body. So we are holographic. We are holographic.
661.12 --> 668.56:  We are made of parts whole. We have 50 trillion cells. Each has the potential knowledge of the
668.56 --> 678.72:  whole organism. So a cell which is a part can change within its own life by taking advantage
678.72 --> 685.44:  of the potential knowledge of the whole. That's why epigenetics exist. 20 years ago, if you said
685.44 --> 694.08:  epigenetics, you would have put into the corner as a crazy guy. Okay, now we know that epigenetics
694.08 --> 704.64:  exist. Why? Because every part is a part whole. So we as human beings, we are fields which are part
704.64 --> 711.52:  whole of one, the totality of what exists. Same pattern repeated at different scales.
712.48 --> 719.12:  Very nice. We are going deeper right now. And I think good for people to understand this comes
719.12 --> 725.68:  from the architect of the first microprocessor. If we have that cell, that part whole, as you
725.68 --> 732.00:  mentioned, and we have a modern-day microprocessor that many people attribute sort of the same
732.00 --> 738.96:  intelligence or complexity to, because that's the idea, right? Because it's just so many connections,
738.96 --> 743.92:  so many computing power. So many people think we will achieve sort of cell-like and then of course
745.20 --> 750.88:  organism-like intelligence. Can you just on the ground level make that comparison, the cell versus
750.88 --> 759.36:  the microprocessor? Yeah, a microprocessor is made of switches. On, off, on, off, on, off.
760.00 --> 767.84:  What does this switch know about the whole? The old computer. Nothing. It doesn't know anything.
768.96 --> 776.88:  The most, all that it could possibly know is that it's open or closed. And, but it can do nothing else.
779.92 --> 787.76:  Every cell of my body is connected to the whole through these quantum fields.
788.08 --> 795.12:  Because a cell is a quantum classical thing. It's not a classical thing. It has been studied as
795.12 --> 806.72:  biochemistry. But, by biologists, it's an informational system of a kind that we have still to understand
806.72 --> 812.88:  the foundation. It's quantum and classical. Quantum and classical. Nobody understands our
812.88 --> 820.48:  life works. It goes way beyond what we understand. We think it's a mechanism. And that's because
820.48 --> 826.96:  those cells remain connected with the fields. Because they're made of particles. And quantum
826.96 --> 835.52:  physics is telling us that particles are not objects. Particles are states of a field. They
835.52 --> 841.52:  cannot be taken away from the fields. They are not separable from the fields. They are like
842.32 --> 848.88:  like a wave of the sea cannot be taken out of the sea. But what many people, I think, and this
848.88 --> 856.56:  we really need to clarify, I think, okay, in a cell we have proteins bumping around, which are in the
856.56 --> 863.12:  end complex molecules. In a computer we have electrons that are also particles. What exactly
863.12 --> 870.24:  makes the molecules, the particles within the cell, quantum classical and a computer purely classical?
870.24 --> 874.48:  Because I'd say, okay, aren't there quantum effects as well in computers that connect them to that
874.48 --> 880.88:  field you were talking about? Yeah, but the quantum effects are incoherent and they cancel out. So the
880.88 --> 890.96:  quantumness is canceled out. The bit is the average of quantum phenomena. They cancel out. And then
890.96 --> 897.76:  therefore, first of all, the bit is not a physical thing. It's an abstraction that we have created.
898.64 --> 906.40:  What is zero and what is one? We have determined. And as long as within the system, the zero and the
906.40 --> 912.96:  one as the simplest possible symbols can be recognized as zero and one. That's all that is needed.
913.52 --> 918.80:  So if you maintain that coherence, but it's a classical coherence, because the zero and the one
919.76 --> 928.08:  are classical information that can be reproduced. A quantum bit cannot be reproduced. A quantum bit.
929.04 --> 934.96:  When you measure the quantum bit, you get zero or one in the direction in which you measure it.
934.96 --> 937.92:  But you have to set the direction because if you don't know the direction,
939.20 --> 943.68:  whichever any direction that you choose, you will find zero or one. The
943.84 --> 950.32:  Olivos theorem says that the maximum information that you can get from a quantum bit is a classical
950.32 --> 958.88:  bit. The quantum bit cannot be known. The note-cloning theorem says that you cannot clone even a
958.88 --> 964.40:  quantum bit. Yeah, once we want to know the quantum state, it will collapse in a state which is a zero
964.40 --> 970.56:  or one and we are in a classical world. Yeah, but you are in classical. So quantum information
970.56 --> 977.60:  cannot be reproduced. Quantum information cannot be reproduced. Classical information can be reproduced.
979.20 --> 986.64:  We are quantum fields. What we feel within can be represented by quantum information.
989.60 --> 996.88:  What we feel goes beyond the representation. The representation is mathematics, is the map.
997.84 --> 1004.64:  What we feel is the territory. Is what we feel is only within the field. That's how we know.
1004.64 --> 1012.00:  The meaning is within us, is within the field, is not in the information. Physics, the information
1012.00 --> 1023.60:  in physics has no meaning. And the problem with the current worldview is that if you start with
1024.56 --> 1030.64:  this type of information, there is no meaning. Then you cannot conclude that the universe is without
1031.28 --> 1038.00:  meaning and purpose just because you have started that way. But in fact, if you start with quantum
1038.00 --> 1043.60:  information, people cannot explain why you cannot copy quantum information. Why cannot not copy
1043.60 --> 1053.04:  quantum information? Then the new theory says consciousness and free will are foundational,
1053.12 --> 1058.64:  cannot be explained with anything simpler. But if you start with that, you can explain why quantum
1058.64 --> 1072.08:  physics must be the way it is. Exactly the upside. Again, the silicon gate technology turning around
1072.08 --> 1077.52:  the problem. You go from here to there instead of going from there to here. And there is collapse
1077.52 --> 1083.12:  of the wave function, which are free will's decision of the field, of the various fields
1083.12 --> 1087.20:  that are interacting and creating this thing that emerges from these fields.
1088.80 --> 1094.64:  The particle is not separable from the field. It's integral to the fields. Then they forget
1094.64 --> 1100.24:  about it. Then they think of the particle a little ball. The people that study biology think that
1100.24 --> 1106.56:  their cell is classical. It is not classical. Yeah, they think of the rule of large numbers,
1106.72 --> 1111.84:  because quantum effects are on a sort of subatomic particle level. It filters out, it
1111.84 --> 1114.64:  cancels out, and then we have the classical world, which is again deterministic. No, they don't
1114.64 --> 1119.60:  cancel out inside the cell. They work together to create these structures that they don't even
1119.60 --> 1126.32:  understand that is going on right now. They don't understand how the cell works as a totality.
1127.76 --> 1134.64:  We are instructed not to understand. We are going through blinders. We don't understand.
1135.20 --> 1144.40:  There is, for example, about 10 years ago, so a few physicists and biologists, but people with
1144.96 --> 1152.80:  strong knowledge of physics, started saying, hey, life, there must be something quantum in life.
1152.80 --> 1161.60:  Oh, forget it. No, possible. And they were ostracized. And eventually, there is a very small
1161.60 --> 1168.88:  cadre of quantum biologists called now, people that are trying to understand life as a quantum
1168.88 --> 1174.96:  phenomenon. They are still ostracized, but at least now they have some money to do research.
1175.52 --> 1183.20:  But for 10 years, it was like everybody knows that, I mean, this dogmas of the sort of the
1183.84 --> 1195.52:  or orthodoxy of science are impeding us to really make progress. And it's time to stop this.
1196.08 --> 1204.08:  But there is a strong desire for this orthodoxy to keep this materialist and reductionist
1204.08 --> 1210.80:  framework that has shown that it is no longer valid. Everybody knows. I mean, people that really
1210.88 --> 1214.64:  think, but they don't want that because it's power.
1215.76 --> 1220.64:  And how? But if we go back, I really like when you talk about sort of because I think that's the
1220.64 --> 1226.64:  real nuts and bolts. We go into the eukaryotic cell and we see the proteins. We have the DNA. We
1226.64 --> 1232.88:  have all the action going on in a cell, which is tremendously complex. But we think we can reduce
1232.88 --> 1237.12:  it to first principles because we know what those molecules do to each other. And then it's just a
1237.12 --> 1241.36:  rule of large numbers, which will give us sort of the action of the cell and will build up to the
1241.36 --> 1247.04:  organism. But you were saying that on that level, quantum effects are playing a role, which make
1247.04 --> 1252.96:  action within the cell indeterministic and even a free will decision. Absolutely. But the free
1252.96 --> 1257.28:  will decision is not in the cell. It's in the fields that control the cell.
1258.00 --> 1267.12:  See, I was mentioning before that a particle like an electron doesn't exist separate from the fields.
1267.12 --> 1274.48:  It's the state of the field. From a physics point of view, ontology is in the field,
1275.20 --> 1282.56:  is not in the particles because the particles are integral to the field. So they come and they go.
1283.12 --> 1289.36:  If a particle existed, it wouldn't disappear, right? But an electron can appear and disappear.
1289.36 --> 1295.68:  But it is a state of a field that appears or disappear. There is nothing more. There is no
1295.68 --> 1302.56:  particle. But physicists, the particle, physicists, but I see the particles. No, you don't see the
1302.56 --> 1310.24:  particles. You see the effect of the state of the field on this classical world. And then you
1310.40 --> 1318.64:  see something, but that is not a particle. That is the effect of something that was amplified
1319.36 --> 1324.72:  in a huge number of times to give you what you call a particle.
1325.84 --> 1331.36:  And to clarify this for people, when we talk about quantum and classical, the classical world
1331.36 --> 1337.76:  is the world of matter that we know that seems to behave deterministically. And the quantum world,
1337.76 --> 1343.04:  of course, is a world of probabilities, right? Of multiple states being possible at once.
1343.60 --> 1350.32:  And how exactly do they relate, if you say quantum classical? So what bit of our body is classical?
1350.32 --> 1356.08:  Of course, my body doesn't evaporate while I'm sitting here. So that would make it classical.
1356.08 --> 1365.28:  But my thoughts are quantum. Yes. Okay. So first of all, there is no clear boundary between classical
1366.24 --> 1372.16:  and quantum. In other words, we again want to put things into boxes. That's the first mistake.
1373.04 --> 1381.76:  There are no separate boxes. One is holistic. The reality, deeper reality is holistic, means
1381.76 --> 1389.20:  is not made of separable parts. And it's not made of separable concepts, which is even deeper.
1390.16 --> 1399.92:  So even true or false is an approximation of reality valid under certain conditions.
1399.92 --> 1405.36:  Like one and zero are valid for a certain temperature and pressure of the computer. If you
1405.36 --> 1411.44:  change the temperature, it doesn't work anymore. Because that distinction can no longer be valid
1411.44 --> 1417.52:  in a world where there is a continuity. That everything is connected with everything else.
1418.24 --> 1423.76:  So but we don't want that world because you cannot control that world. So the problem now
1423.76 --> 1431.04:  is a problem of power and control behind this desire to have a deterministic and
1431.04 --> 1437.36:  reductionistic world, which is the materialist philosophy, which is it's time to abandon that
1437.36 --> 1444.24:  because quantum physics already is saying that that doesn't work. You know, according to quantum
1444.24 --> 1452.00:  physics, the universe is holistic, is not made of separable parts. Everything is connected.
1452.64 --> 1459.12:  Everything is connected from the inside. But according to most physicists, there is no inside
1459.12 --> 1464.64:  because everything, you know, they think that all that exists is actually what you can measure.
1465.60 --> 1472.56:  But that is not possible. Nobody can understand why quantum computers work because their actual
1472.64 --> 1479.20:  operation cannot occur in space time. It must occur in what is called Hilbert space.
1479.76 --> 1484.64:  But Hilbert space supposed to be a mathematical obstruction. So how can you do
1484.64 --> 1492.40:  operations in an abstract space of mathematics? You see, it's incoherent. But nobody wants to
1492.40 --> 1498.96:  think deeply about this stuff because nobody has ever taught how to think deeply about stuff.
1499.52 --> 1502.88:  They want to solve the problem and give me the equation and solve the equations.
1503.44 --> 1509.84:  But the equations are created by consciousness. It is consciousness that creates mathematics,
1509.84 --> 1518.80:  not mathematics that creates consciousness. It took me 30 years to figure out that mathematics
1519.68 --> 1525.36:  is created by consciousness and therefore I cannot explain consciousness with mathematics.
1525.36 --> 1529.84:  And I realized that I was trying to do the same because I was taught that way. I had to turn it
1529.84 --> 1537.84:  around. Again, turn it around. And we can only touch, let's say, but we can touch sort of at the
1537.84 --> 1543.68:  outer surface of consciousness with mathematics. It's our own understanding of ourselves. So would
1544.88 --> 1550.64:  Schrodinger's wave function, which describes sort of the state of a quantum system, is that
1550.64 --> 1554.64:  touching on the outside of consciousness? Is that as close as we can get with mathematics?
1555.12 --> 1562.88:  Of course. Of course. In fact, we have to go way beyond Schrodinger's equation. We had to go into
1562.88 --> 1569.36:  the Rack's equation, but even beyond that, we had to go to quantum fields. So n-quantum
1569.36 --> 1575.92:  information. And quantum information goes beyond the concepts of quantum fields. In fact, the only
1575.92 --> 1583.12:  physicist that's been able to show that quantum physics derives from quantum information is an
1583.20 --> 1591.44:  Italian physicist, Giacomo Mauro Dariano, University of Pavia. And it took me 15, 20 years to do that
1591.44 --> 1597.52:  and it showed that you can derive all the equations of quantum physics from quantum bits.
1598.48 --> 1606.08:  So you remember probably about John Wheeler, you know, it from bit. Yeah, he had the original
1606.08 --> 1617.04:  intuition that information had to be more profound, more deeper than matter. It from bit. So the bit
1617.04 --> 1625.68:  was deeper, but he should have said it from qubit, but never mind. Because the deeper information
1625.68 --> 1633.36:  is quantum information. And Dariano and his collaborators prove that you can derive quantum
1633.36 --> 1640.72:  physics from quantum information. So quantum information now becomes the ontology based on
1640.72 --> 1646.56:  Dariano's work. What would be a way for people to understand what quantum information really is?
1646.56 --> 1653.36:  So it's basically instead of having bits, you know, arrangements of bits, you have arrangements of
1653.36 --> 1660.96:  quantum bits. A quantum bit, imagine a quantum bit as a one of an infinite possibilities that can be
1660.96 --> 1666.80:  represented as a point on the surface of a sphere. So you have a sphere, every point on the surface
1666.80 --> 1673.76:  of the sphere, which would correspond into a direction in 3D, is one of the possible states.
1673.76 --> 1682.56:  So a qubit implies an infinity of states. But when you make a measurement, all you can find zero one.
1683.60 --> 1689.44:  So and you cannot, when you make a measurement, you disturb this quantum bit. So you don't,
1689.52 --> 1693.84:  you know, you basically, you disturb it in the direction in which you make the measurement
1694.64 --> 1701.68:  and you get zero or one. And that's it. In any direction that you measure, you get zero one.
1701.68 --> 1710.08:  But you don't get zero one repeatedly. You get it with some probability. So the quantum physics
1710.08 --> 1716.64:  doesn't tell you what the next state is. It only can tell you the probability of all the possible
1716.64 --> 1722.80:  states that you can measure. So in the case of a quantum bit, it tells you if you measure in,
1722.80 --> 1728.80:  in this direction, let's say, it tells you the probability that you get a zero or one. But it
1728.80 --> 1735.92:  doesn't tell you that you get a zero or one. So the fundamental difference between quantum physics
1735.92 --> 1742.00:  and classical physics is that quantum physics is indeterminate, meaning it doesn't tell you,
1742.00 --> 1747.52:  you only can tell you probability, but not the probability of what you will measure. No,
1747.52 --> 1754.32:  the probability of all the possible states that you can measure. Okay. And the, the, to go from
1754.32 --> 1761.36:  this probability field to what you will measure, there is no physics. There is the collapse of
1761.36 --> 1768.24:  the wave function. It's just a way of saying that we don't know. Basically, you go from,
1768.64 --> 1778.96:  you have an interaction between the fields and an instrument that does a measurement. And somehow,
1779.52 --> 1786.56:  in this interaction, you get one state. But, but that state that you get, you can only know the
1786.56 --> 1791.84:  probability and you don't know how you get that state. Not only that, but we know that that state
1792.48 --> 1801.76:  is random, but also the randomness is not algorithmic, is beyond algorithms. And that's the rub.
1802.72 --> 1809.92:  That's where, that's where free will is. In this theory with Dariano, we say free will
1811.12 --> 1817.76:  is what is happening with what we call collapse of the wave function is a free will decision of the
1817.84 --> 1823.68:  field of whatever particle you're measuring. And because that's interesting, because I always thought
1823.68 --> 1828.08:  because the rule of large numbers, when we do quantum measurements over and over a thousand
1828.08 --> 1833.20:  times, then we get again a probabilistic or sorry, a deterministic rule because you then just get an
1834.72 --> 1839.20:  wave function that will give you sort of. But inside the cell, you only, you only get one,
1839.20 --> 1843.12:  you only want, you do one thing at a time. You don't do, you don't repeat the things.
1843.92 --> 1851.04:  Ah, yeah, now I get it. That's crazy. That's crazy. Let's try and really understand this.
1851.04 --> 1855.68:  Okay, classical information is information we can share because it's like a written word that we
1855.68 --> 1860.32:  can kind of show around. I cannot show around what I'm feeling right now to all of you. So the moment
1860.32 --> 1866.16:  I speak a word, I've made a feeling I had. I've turned it into classical information.
1866.16 --> 1872.40:  Yes, right. You take something which is private that cannot be reproduced, can only be represented
1872.40 --> 1879.60:  by quantum information. But the representation is not what you feel. The representation of reality
1879.60 --> 1887.28:  is not reality. A theory of reality is not reality. Okay, so what you feel only you feel,
1887.84 --> 1897.20:  nobody, you feel, can actually know and you know inside. And what you can say about what you feel
1897.20 --> 1903.84:  is a small part of what you feel. Olivos theorem, one bit per quantum bit. And the quantum bits are
1903.84 --> 1911.68:  entangled so they have states in common with the bits don't have states in common, zero or one.
1912.32 --> 1918.80:  There is nothing else. But quantum bits may have states in common, meaning that the probability,
1918.80 --> 1925.28:  the two probabilities are connected. And to show this connection, you cannot do, you have to describe
1925.28 --> 1932.32:  the quantum state in Hilbert space, which is an n dimensional space with complex dimensions,
1932.32 --> 1937.36:  where the dimensions are complex numbers. You know, it's just enough to give you a headache, right?
1938.00 --> 1943.28:  But that's what you need. You cannot represent them in this way. So what does it mean that there is
1943.28 --> 1953.44:  a deeper reality where the feelings and the fields exist, the meaning of information exists,
1954.24 --> 1961.68:  that and from that world, you have this world that is a classical world where you can get
1961.68 --> 1967.76:  classical information. And we think that the only world that exists is this world. But this world
1967.76 --> 1973.44:  we have constructed with our bodies. And it's a way to look at it. I think you have this metaphor
1973.44 --> 1982.88:  yet in silicon that would it be like consciousness being the field, writing a book and the book itself
1982.88 --> 1988.40:  is our space dimension, our body sitting here, or a film recording a film and showing it the film
1988.40 --> 1994.56:  shown on the screen of perception. Yeah, but the book emerges into this three dimensional reality,
1994.56 --> 2000.88:  but the writer of the book is in a deeper, faster reality. Exactly, it's not in the book.
2000.88 --> 2007.84:  And my body here is a sentence in that book. The body is a symbol. It's a symbol of a complexity
2007.84 --> 2015.68:  which is unfathomable for now. Okay, people will find this crazy idea. It is crazy. Yeah. But it is
2015.68 --> 2023.36:  much closer to the truth than what you get from the scientism. Yeah, because that I wanted to ask.
2024.24 --> 2029.20:  It's crazy, but quantum theory is crazy. So if we have the other explanation, if we don't want to go
2029.20 --> 2036.16:  to consciousness, if we say no, it's still matter all the way down. How then, where do we then end
2036.16 --> 2040.64:  up with interpreting quantum mechanics? Then we have to go like many worlds or how do you...
2043.36 --> 2049.84:  There is no interpretation that anybody can agree on. For the 100 years, I mean,
2049.84 --> 2056.16:  this promise has been discussed for 100 years and there is no interpretation whatsoever about
2056.16 --> 2059.84:  quantum physics. Couldn't we say there's a multiverse with everything possible,
2059.84 --> 2066.56:  being possible in other dimensions? Yeah, but it doesn't explain anything. What is it explaining?
2066.56 --> 2075.12:  When I say consciousness and free will must be taken as foundational as a postulate. Okay?
2076.08 --> 2085.84:  But why do I say that? Because postulates ought to be self evident. The condition to accept the
2085.84 --> 2092.40:  postulate is a self evident. Why is a self evident? Because you and I are conscious. You and I know
2092.40 --> 2099.04:  that we have limited, but we have free will, limited, but we have it. So we know already that. How can
2099.04 --> 2105.12:  you explain free will and consciousness with something that doesn't have either? You cannot
2105.12 --> 2110.72:  explain it. How can you explain consciousness with math when it's consciousness that created math?
2110.72 --> 2116.32:  When can you explain free will with something that doesn't have free will? You see, it's foolish to
2116.32 --> 2125.28:  think that you can explain more with less. And today, we talk about emergent properties. We
2125.28 --> 2131.44:  explain everything with emergentism. What does it mean emergentism? How can you get more with less?
2131.44 --> 2139.76:  You cannot. You can get less from more. You can get determinism from indeterminism. You can get
2139.76 --> 2146.80:  unconsciousness from consciousness, not the other way around. And that's so simple and so common sense.
2147.36 --> 2151.84:  But science doesn't want to go there. Why? Scientism doesn't want to go there. Why?
2152.72 --> 2158.56:  Because you lose your power. Because if I know the equations, I know more than you.
2159.28 --> 2167.12:  And that's not acceptable. Because nobody knows the equations. Because there is no equations
2167.12 --> 2175.20:  that describe free will. Free will is an act that no laws can tell what the free will can give you.
2175.20 --> 2180.32:  And people want to predict the future. Their safety is in the prediction of the future. Their sense of
2180.32 --> 2185.84:  power is in prediction of the future. You cannot predict the future. Because it's based on free will.
2187.28 --> 2194.08:  Nobody wants to go there right now. But that's the only way to go, to be safe from this idea
2194.80 --> 2198.80:  that we are machines and that artificial intelligence will best us.
2199.60 --> 2205.76:  Your postulate of free will, you experience free will, isn't that just an illusion? I mean,
2206.40 --> 2210.32:  does free will truly exist? Or is it something we think we have?
2213.04 --> 2221.36:  Why do you, people that say this, you have to ask them, why do you insist that there is no free will?
2221.36 --> 2227.28:  What do you get by insisting that there is no free will? Think deeply about that.
2228.40 --> 2234.00:  What do you get by thinking that there is no free will? That you do not have any free will?
2234.00 --> 2240.40:  Why do you want that? And if you answer that question, they have to answer that question.
2240.40 --> 2245.52:  But if they answer that question, they will find out more about themselves. And eventually,
2245.52 --> 2255.44:  they will have to agree that they have a hidden desire to control, to have power. Because they
2255.44 --> 2263.44:  know the equations. They know more than you. That's the point. I mean, I was there. I was,
2263.44 --> 2269.36:  you know, I had taken the same courses. I learned the same physics. And if I did not have this
2269.36 --> 2278.00:  experience that told me that I'm more, I couldn't be here saying these things. But now I can,
2278.08 --> 2285.52:  you know, with this experience, I was able to invert our understanding and point in the way
2285.52 --> 2292.08:  to a different way to understand. So, you know, if it's bullshit, it will be found to be bullshit.
2292.08 --> 2297.12:  But don't say there is bullshit just because you don't want to even think about it. And that's the
2297.12 --> 2304.08:  problem today. People, the first time they hear the wrong word from them, they shut off and
2304.64 --> 2310.08:  not, you know, they don't even want to think about it. But actually, the reason why we know
2310.88 --> 2316.56:  is because we are conscious. The reason why we know is because we are conscious. Because
2316.56 --> 2324.24:  consciousness is what allows us to know. Computers don't know. It's foolish to think that computers
2324.24 --> 2331.44:  understand. They don't understand. There is no meaning in the bits. The meaning can only be
2331.44 --> 2338.32:  quantum. It can only be something that exists in the field. It doesn't even exist in quantum
2338.32 --> 2344.96:  information. Quantum information can only represent what we know as meaning. You see,
2344.96 --> 2353.04:  mathematics stops there for now. But there is a new math to be developed to go from qualia,
2353.68 --> 2359.12:  qualia, which is sensations and feelings that can be represented by quantum information.
2359.12 --> 2364.64:  Quantum information cannot represent the meaning. They represent the qualia. That's all they can do,
2364.64 --> 2372.40:  which is how we feel. But qualia is the beginning of the inner journey. Qualia are the bringers of
2372.40 --> 2379.92:  meaning. And we look for meaning. First comprehension and then meaning. Comprehension gets you to
2379.92 --> 2385.20:  meaning. Meaning is the essence of comprehension. Meaning is what you get after you got it.
2386.16 --> 2393.52:  You know, I got it. I understand it now. That's beyond comprehension. Comprehension is a path to
2394.16 --> 2398.96:  meaning. And meaning is the ontology. The ontology is in the meaning, in the experience,
2398.96 --> 2402.80:  in what we feel, in what we know, from within. Not outside.
2404.96 --> 2410.64:  If you say meaning is the ontology, so meaning is what ultimately exists in our universe?
2410.72 --> 2418.56:  Yeah. Yeah. But in order to make it more understandable, I started with a postulate.
2419.76 --> 2428.24:  I started this all basic, rich framing with a postulate, because I'm joining science and
2428.24 --> 2437.52:  spirituality. I'm joining the outer and the inner. Science is about the outer world, but meaning,
2438.48 --> 2444.24:  experience, consciousness, free will is about the inner world. And right now, they're separate.
2444.24 --> 2450.88:  There is the spiritual people that think that this exists, but the scientist doesn't mean.
2452.32 --> 2458.32:  These guys look at, those guys say, it doesn't matter, doesn't care. So there is this separation
2458.32 --> 2464.16:  now between science and spirituality. This way of thinking brings them together. They
2464.24 --> 2470.40:  integrate them. Don't just oppose them. They integrate. They become one. They become one.
2470.40 --> 2476.72:  So how do we start? So if we want to start like a new theory, I start with a postulate,
2476.72 --> 2483.52:  because you had to. Because you can never start with something that is true, because you have shown
2483.52 --> 2487.36:  to be true, you have to start with postulate. Even in math, you start with postulates that are
2487.36 --> 2492.48:  taken to be true, and they had to be self-evident. Yeah. So ground assumption. Ground assumption.
2492.88 --> 2498.08:  But that ground assumption has to be self-evident. The ground assumption of quantum physics,
2498.08 --> 2504.48:  they are so self-evident that you have to study 10 years before you say, oh, yeah, they are evident,
2504.48 --> 2510.88:  not self-evident. They are evident after 10 years. So they don't pass the test of self-evidence to me.
2510.88 --> 2518.80:  Okay, now I'm going to tell you a postulate that is self-evident. One, the totality of what exists.
2518.80 --> 2525.44:  One, the totality of what exists. It has three properties. Dynamic. Dynamic means it's never
2525.44 --> 2534.72:  the same instant after instant. It's holistic means it's not made of separable parts. And so far,
2534.72 --> 2540.40:  I have described the universe described by quantum physics. Yeah, now you know.
2540.40 --> 2547.84:  As all these three, you know, is all the resist dynamic or listing? I add one more thing,
2547.84 --> 2556.40:  one more quality. One wants to know itself. One wants to know itself. Now, this comes from
2557.28 --> 2565.60:  perennial philosophy. Knowing Thyself was in the, you know, in the Delphi, Delphi, you know,
2565.60 --> 2570.64:  Thampol, you know, it was part of the, you know, part of the Greek, some of the Greek philosophers.
2571.36 --> 2577.60:  But the Vedas were saying the same thing. All the basic experiences of the deepest, the people that
2577.60 --> 2584.00:  went deeper into the understanding or reality come to the same general conclusion that there is one
2584.00 --> 2590.08:  that has those properties and they want to know itself. If I look within myself, what do I want
2590.08 --> 2597.76:  it to know when I was suffering? Who am I? Why am I here? Why am I suffering? That's what does it mean?
2597.76 --> 2604.16:  I want to know myself. So we all want to know ourselves. We all deep down. Then we forget about
2604.16 --> 2609.20:  it because we can do nothing about it. So we go, you know, we go, we try to solve the problem by,
2609.20 --> 2615.12:  you know, going outside ourselves and then we lose ourselves like I did. And then, you know,
2615.12 --> 2623.28:  so if we start there as a, you know, is it self-evident? It was, it is self-evident to me.
2623.28 --> 2628.96:  And if you think a little bit, it's self-evident to you. That is what you want. Okay. So wanting
2629.68 --> 2636.08:  means free will. Because if you are a machine, what, what do you want as a machine? The next state
2636.08 --> 2641.92:  of the machine is already defined by the algorithm. What do you want? It doesn't make any sense. I
2641.92 --> 2646.88:  don't want anything. But the question doesn't even make, there are no questions to a machine. There
2646.88 --> 2658.80:  are only answers to a machine. So, and know to know itself, one must be conscious. Because
2658.80 --> 2664.56:  consciousness is what allows one to know itself. So you have defined, I have defined free will
2664.56 --> 2671.20:  and consciousness. And why are those self-evident? Because you are conscious and you have free will,
2671.20 --> 2676.56:  I am conscious and I have free will. So more self-evident than that, what is there? And if I
2676.56 --> 2685.04:  start there, I can explain quantum physics by that posture. I can explain what physicists in 100
2685.04 --> 2692.48:  years have not understood. Quantum information is the representation of inner experience and the
2692.48 --> 2697.84:  collapse of the wave function is the representation of my free, of the free will. What more do you want?
2698.80 --> 2704.48:  I think it's a great theory because in bridging, as you say, science and spirituality,
2705.60 --> 2709.28:  the two are thought very distinct and very separate, right? Because the,
2712.40 --> 2716.32:  well, it makes me think, I interviewed Donald Hoffman, you know, right? I think your foundation
2716.32 --> 2721.68:  supports his work, right? Yeah, yeah. For about five years. And he said something that stuck with
2721.68 --> 2727.36:  me that he said that all these spiritual traditions, that in a sense are saying what you are saying,
2727.36 --> 2731.84:  that consciousness is fundamental, one wants to know itself. And then we have all the incarnation
2731.84 --> 2737.44:  stories of the gods who incarnate, etc. So we know those stories. But the fact that they've always
2737.44 --> 2743.84:  remained so illusive, so mystical, he said, is nothing to be proud of. We should be like more
2743.84 --> 2749.20:  concrete. We have also our rational faculty, we have science, so we now need to approach this with
2749.20 --> 2754.88:  our sort of scientific mindset. So is that what you're trying to do here? What is more concrete
2754.96 --> 2762.32:  than what I just said? Yeah. And can it lead? I mean, you know, now, if you start here,
2764.72 --> 2772.64:  we can show the science, that not science, the quantum physics out of which everything else
2772.64 --> 2780.16:  emerges. In fact, quantum information, because the quantum state that is a representation of our
2780.16 --> 2789.76:  experience is what then eventually determines the outer world. Okay. So I showed it by starting
2789.76 --> 2795.28:  with the ha something that is kind of ha ha, you know, but it doesn't get you anywhere, actually
2796.00 --> 2802.64:  needs the physics that exists. And now from there we go, we already saw the other promise,
2802.64 --> 2808.16:  I'm not changing anything of physics, I'm reinterpreting completely what physics has been talking about.
2808.72 --> 2816.40:  Hmm. What do you want more? Is that is that Don wants to explain consciousness with mathematics,
2816.40 --> 2823.68:  and you cannot do that. Because consciousness creates mathematics. I wanted to do the same thing
2823.68 --> 2831.84:  for many years. And then I found out that I was wrong. That it is consciousness that explains math.
2833.20 --> 2837.36:  And therefore you go from consciousness to math, you cannot go from math to consciousness,
2837.36 --> 2847.60:  because where does math come from otherwise? Is what will create a math? God? Well, come on. Yeah.
2847.60 --> 2856.00:  How does math exists? Is our creation in human mind, you bet. Federico, you have, it was your
2856.00 --> 2863.04:  intuition that led to your inventions that have changed the world. I think it's fair to say that
2863.04 --> 2869.20:  our help changed the world. Now you have this grand intuition, your theory about consciousness.
2870.00 --> 2879.52:  How can this also lead to technology or to something tangible? Can we test it? Is it falsifiable?
2880.48 --> 2887.12:  Of course it is. In fact, the next step is to now that I have a theory which is absolutely
2887.20 --> 2895.36:  perfect, meaning it can be falsified, it can make predictions, and you can test the prediction.
2895.36 --> 2903.76:  Can you name one? Oh, yes. I can predict that trees are conscious, and I can make experiments
2903.76 --> 2911.52:  that show that trees are conscious, and trees are no brain. So consciousness that is supposed to be
2911.52 --> 2918.48:  coming off our brain, it comes off a tree that has no brain. Look at that. What do you think of that?
2919.44 --> 2925.36:  It's amazing. Yeah. Is this being done? I mean, I will do that. Yeah. I cannot tell you how,
2925.36 --> 2929.68:  because I have to prove it, and don't worry about it. I will do that.
2930.64 --> 2951.20:  All right. Okay. Trees are, yeah. But you actually have a method, a scientific method of testing this.
2951.20 --> 2959.12:  Yes. I will not discuss it any further. I will say, would you agree with me that if I do that,
2960.08 --> 2966.48:  I have disproved that consciousness is a product of the human brain or of the animal brain.
2966.48 --> 2969.44:  Definitely. Is that good? All right. I will do that. That's the deal.
2972.80 --> 2976.48:  Then you have proven that it takes cells, right? Then we are sort of on a cellular level.
2976.48 --> 2981.84:  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. I will prove that.
2983.36 --> 2988.88:  Yeah, you're sure of that? Absolutely. Take me to task. I'll get it.
2989.84 --> 2994.56:  I can guarantee you that I will get it. There's something that people will say,
2996.24 --> 3002.88:  they cannot say anything. They will not have any objection anymore. See, entanglement took
3002.88 --> 3007.44:  over 30 years to prove that entanglement exists after the first experiment showed it exists,
3007.44 --> 3012.80:  because scientists didn't want entanglement. Einstein didn't want entanglement. So everybody,
3012.80 --> 3017.36:  you know, how can an Einstein be wrong? So for 50 years, you couldn't do the experiments.
3018.32 --> 3023.04:  Okay. Finally, when you could do experiments, the first experiment that proved that Alain Aspe
3023.04 --> 3028.96:  got the Nobel Prize three years ago, four years ago, what he did. Anyway, see, he did that. Okay.
3028.96 --> 3033.60:  Then, oh, you did wrong. You couldn't do it. You know, blah, blah, blah. It took more than 30 years
3033.60 --> 3041.20:  after that to, you know, cancel all the objections, you know, show that the objections were not valid.
3041.84 --> 3044.96:  And finally, everybody now has to accept that there is entanglement,
3045.52 --> 3050.96:  but nobody can explain it. Entanglement is what connects everything from the inside,
3050.96 --> 3056.16:  is what allows the world to be holistic, which is already what quantum physics is saying.
3057.44 --> 3062.96:  Are you predicting, I mean, many people think of AI, a sort of an invention that you were at the
3062.96 --> 3070.16:  birth at, right, with the, in your work on neural networks. Yeah, back in the 80s, the second part
3070.16 --> 3075.76:  of the 80s. Yeah. People now think that AI will cause a paradigm shift. What's your response to
3075.76 --> 3080.56:  that? Do you think that AI is? Not only this theory will cause a paradigm shift, not because I'm,
3080.56 --> 3086.80:  it's a theory that I developed, but only by changing the understanding of who we are can change a,
3086.80 --> 3095.28:  can change a paradigm. In fact, the paradigm ends with AI. This paradigm of scientism ends with AI,
3095.28 --> 3103.76:  because AI is saying we, machines will be better than us, which is crazy. Why does anybody want
3104.80 --> 3112.08:  AI, despite that, why does anybody want AI to be better than us? But AI cannot be better than us,
3112.08 --> 3118.80:  because creativity is non algorithmic, is not changing things randomly. And, you know, because
3118.80 --> 3124.72:  besides, even if AI gives you a good idea, AI doesn't know that it is a good idea. You recognize
3124.72 --> 3130.08:  the good idea of AI. Still need your consciousness, with your understanding, with your comprehension.
3130.72 --> 3140.08:  And that's why AI can help us. And I applaud what has happened to AI, but not the AI bests us and not
3140.08 --> 3146.48:  the way AI, unfortunately, will be used to monetize us. That's not acceptable. I agree. I agree.
3147.12 --> 3151.36:  I think you would also fully agree to that quote by Nikola Tesla, right? That the, yes,
3151.44 --> 3156.96:  is famous saying that the moment science will start studying consciousness, more will be achieved
3156.96 --> 3160.64:  in a decade than in the whole history of science. Absolutely, because we change the way we are.
3162.56 --> 3168.72:  Thoughts are more important than stuff, right? I mean,
3170.96 --> 3178.72:  from the inside, you get the outside, not vice versa. And science doesn't recognize the existence
3178.72 --> 3183.68:  of the inside, because consciousness is a phenomenon of the brain. The brain that makes
3183.68 --> 3188.24:  decisions that informs your consciousness, we don't know where it is, but it doesn't have any cause of
3188.24 --> 3195.84:  power, so who cares? Once we, people are convinced that we are conscious, that we are filled,
3196.56 --> 3200.80:  that when the body dies, we don't die. I mean, that's a good news, right? I mean, you know,
3200.80 --> 3205.92:  people want you to discharge your consciousness and experience it on the computer and live forever,
3205.92 --> 3213.44:  for Christ's sake. I mean, you know, about transhumanism. I mean, why do we need to do that?
3213.44 --> 3218.96:  Besides, you know, you need to have a lot of money to pay for a billion years of electricity to keep
3218.96 --> 3225.12:  you alive in a computer. So this is only a good recipe for very rich people, right? To live forever
3225.12 --> 3230.00:  on a computer. The computer has to suck energy, right? So to make you live forever, you have to
3230.00 --> 3234.72:  have a lot of money before you die to give to people that tell you that you continue to die.
3234.72 --> 3239.44:  Are you sure that you will be continuing to die in a computer, you know, a thousand years later?
3241.76 --> 3247.36:  I fully agree. Where could this, where could this lead to if that Tesla quote is true,
3247.36 --> 3252.64:  if we would fully dedicate ourselves in trying to understand consciousness with your theory,
3252.64 --> 3256.56:  even build technology with it, where could we be in a decade? I mean, could we break out of
3256.56 --> 3261.92:  space time? Could we sort of live forever? What are your thoughts? Once you understand that
3263.44 --> 3271.28:  consciousness is beyond matter, beyond this space and time, we already know that we can explore
3271.28 --> 3276.56:  this world by going out of body with our consciousness. And millions of people that go
3276.56 --> 3282.08:  out of body, explores other realities. Consciousness is the tool for knowing
3282.08 --> 3290.08:  infinitely more powerful than any instrument that we have ever built. We build billions of
3290.08 --> 3295.60:  dollars of instruments to find out what the particles are doing, but consciousness is far,
3295.60 --> 3303.20:  far richer. So we basically, then we can begin to explore the universe, the invisible universe.
3304.48 --> 3311.68:  What mistakes and sort of sages and in religions have been doing
3311.68 --> 3319.04:  for thousands of years, but also a bit in a way that sometimes led to the waging of wars,
3319.04 --> 3326.24:  because people want to again, sort of use it for politics. Can we transcend that then? What is the
3326.24 --> 3336.08:  ultimate dream you have for society? But when you understand who you are, you know that the only way
3336.16 --> 3341.84:  to work together is cooperation, not competition. Today, there is only competition. Today,
3342.40 --> 3349.04:  the purpose of life is the survival of the fittest. Is there anything worse than that as a
3349.04 --> 3356.16:  purpose of life? Besides, if you ask me, how do you define fitness? The only definition that
3356.16 --> 3363.52:  they would give you is, oh, fitter is the one that survives. So what kind of a law is that?
3364.48 --> 3372.72:  The survival of the what survives. I mean, it's tautology. It's not even informative.
3374.08 --> 3386.96:  So we believe that that definition of life is so wrong, because it basically impedes you to be
3386.96 --> 3393.04:  cooperative, impedes us to work together to understand. But once you have a direct experience
3393.04 --> 3399.84:  of who you are, when you are the observer and the observer, you know directly who you are.
3400.56 --> 3406.40:  And when you know that, you know that only cooperation is the game. We have to work together.
3406.40 --> 3413.36:  That's the only way. So competition will die off just by that experience. I cannot be competitive
3414.00 --> 3420.88:  after that experience. It's impossible. You know, competition is not the competition.
3420.88 --> 3426.88:  The competition that is allowed is that competition that allows me, not me to win,
3427.44 --> 3433.12:  me to be better than I was the day before. Yeah, exactly. Because if one wants to know itself,
3433.12 --> 3440.48:  and it's only one, then also competing with yourself. Not with others. But there's no competition.
3440.48 --> 3447.76:  There is actually the urge to self-development, to be more than you were.
3447.76 --> 3454.24:  If we have one on the ultimate level in the quantum fields, in the unified field, right,
3455.52 --> 3461.12:  how then do we have, how do we get to the many? How do we get to sort of unistill on a quantum
3461.12 --> 3468.24:  level? You call, you talk about seities, right? How does one get to different or gazillions of
3468.24 --> 3481.44:  seities? Yeah. So if we start from that principle, that postulate, then one, you know, one wants to
3481.44 --> 3489.04:  know itself, right? So the moment that one knows itself, he has to know completely itself,
3489.76 --> 3493.68:  because it's not made of parts. He cannot know a part of itself. He has to know the totality of
3493.68 --> 3501.36:  itself. But to know itself, he has to, you know, he has a flash, and it cannot happen in different
3501.36 --> 3509.60:  times. He has to happen in an instant that knows itself, in its own totality. In that instant,
3509.60 --> 3515.92:  it creates a part whole of itself. Just like a meiosis, right? The splitting of self. Absolutely.
3515.92 --> 3522.72:  That's where life takes form. Life is the reproduction of one. It's so fundamental that
3522.72 --> 3528.88:  it is the reproduction of one. One knowing itself creates another one part whole, though,
3529.44 --> 3534.80:  because it creates many, so it cannot be the totality. So it cannot copy itself, but it creates
3535.76 --> 3543.36:  what he saw, what he got, what he understood itself to be. That's the identity of the field
3543.36 --> 3549.92:  the one is created. It's not a copy you say, but it is a part whole. Yeah. One is looking at itself
3550.00 --> 3556.08:  in one direction, and one is infinite direction in which he can know itself. The next time that
3556.08 --> 3561.36:  he's looking at itself in a different direction is another part whole. It's another monad.
3561.36 --> 3570.00:  Liveness got it right. Liveness was the only philosopher, scientist, mathematician, technologist.
3570.00 --> 3575.68:  I mean, it was incredible mind. He got it right. He understood that, but it was before quantum
3575.68 --> 3584.72:  physics. It was way before we could make sense of it, but he got it right. I call him before I knew
3586.72 --> 3592.64:  because I didn't study philosophy. I got into what philosophers have been saying by inner
3592.64 --> 3597.20:  experiences and then thinking about it, trying to understand them scientifically and understand
3597.20 --> 3604.88:  them rationally. I found that many people have said the same things that I came up to through
3604.88 --> 3609.44:  this process, through this inner process, not by reading books and repeating what I read.
3611.20 --> 3617.20:  So the satiety that is sort of... The satiety is what I call a field that is conscious and
3617.20 --> 3621.52:  has free will and wants to know itself. I call them satiety to distinguish them from the quantum
3621.52 --> 3627.20:  fields which don't have consciousness, free will, and don't want to know themselves. But they have
3627.20 --> 3633.28:  all the characteristics of the quantum fields in the terms of what you can explain to them based on
3633.28 --> 3638.64:  physics. But they go beyond that because they are in their life. It's beyond physics.
3639.44 --> 3646.32:  So physics can only explain qualia, which is the entry point to the inner world. But from qualia
3646.32 --> 3652.72:  to meaning, as I said, there is comprehension, then meaning is all new physics. And new physics
3653.36 --> 3658.72:  can only go up to a certain point and then you have to leave even physics. It's got to go to
3659.36 --> 3664.40:  what we now call metaphysics. But it's what can only be known from the inside.
3665.36 --> 3675.60:  But it will take centuries to go through. But the key thing though, it shows that physics now
3675.60 --> 3682.64:  is incomplete because it doesn't even allow the inner world to exist. And the reason why they
3682.64 --> 3690.56:  struggle for 80 years to unify quantum physics and general relativity is because the fundamental
3690.56 --> 3696.96:  concepts of time, space, matter, and energy are wrong. Then they're almost right, but they're not
3698.40 --> 3707.12:  close to the truth. That they allow you to bring together into a unified physical field
3707.76 --> 3713.44:  what is now two separate, one is a set of fields and the other one is the space time
3714.56 --> 3721.28:  and gravity. And if we say the sati is... The sati is who we are. Yeah, exactly, it's who we are.
3722.96 --> 3731.60:  It's a quantum field with this characteristic. But in identity, the identity is, my identity is
3731.68 --> 3739.20:  how one has seen itself when it created me. Yeah, exactly. You're like a frame in a
3739.20 --> 3746.08:  sermon of the universe. Yeah, imagine, you know, it's a beautiful way to understand this.
3746.08 --> 3753.28:  Imagine that you have a multidimensional thing. Okay, it's a multidimensional object,
3753.28 --> 3760.48:  multidimensional meaning in n where n is potentially infinite dimensions. How can you know this object?
3761.20 --> 3767.92:  You can know this object by looking at this object through all the dimensions that are orthogonal,
3767.92 --> 3773.52:  that allow you to look at this object. Each look, you see something, then the next look,
3774.32 --> 3780.96:  so you're doing a tomography of an n-dimensional thing. So it's one doing a tomography on itself.
3781.52 --> 3787.20:  You see? Yeah, and what happens, I mean, for people to understand, what happens when we die
3788.00 --> 3793.36:  at the satiety? We don't go anywhere because we never wear in the body. It's the body that
3793.36 --> 3800.00:  dies. If we don't die, we don't die. But something changes, right? Because the satiety... Of course,
3801.04 --> 3808.64:  the satiety that, see, a portion of the satiety called ego is the portion of the satiety that
3808.64 --> 3815.76:  thinks to be the body. When the body, and so it looks at the information that the body provides
3815.76 --> 3823.92:  about what? About this other world, seeing through the body. So our senses, our brain,
3825.44 --> 3832.08:  takes information from here, but a small part of information, I mean, just the visual thing that
3832.08 --> 3838.72:  we see. It's this narrow band, right? I mean, if I had cell phones instead of eyes, I would actually
3838.80 --> 3848.00:  now be able to listen in to the 30,000 conversations that are going on that are here, here, here, here,
3848.00 --> 3856.08:  they're all here. And I could see them, I could hear them, I could, you know, do this. But I only
3856.08 --> 3860.08:  see this band, there is no, you know, there is no communication in this band. There are other
3860.08 --> 3865.28:  stuff and we see this world. We constructed with the body. The body, the output of the body,
3865.36 --> 3872.96:  which is in the cells, is quantum. That quantum output is what the fields perceive as color,
3872.96 --> 3879.68:  four shapes, sounds, and so on. The qualia, the qualia do not exist in the body, they exist in
3879.68 --> 3891.20:  the field. And the qualia is this, are representable with quantum state. Quantum state is how the
3891.20 --> 3897.68:  quantum field transform, translates this information in the cells, which is, I call it live
3897.68 --> 3903.12:  information. It's a type of information that has not been studied at all, not even imagined at all,
3903.12 --> 3909.04:  which is in between quantum information and classical information. It is the stuff that makes the
3909.04 --> 3918.80:  cell work. Because if you take an electron, take an electron, an electron is matter, energy,
3919.36 --> 3927.60:  and information. Can you separate these three in an electron? It's elementary particles. There you go.
3928.88 --> 3933.52:  So they are connected. And it's like in the cells, there's no distinction between hardware and
3933.52 --> 3937.68:  software, right? They're like totally mingled. That's right. In a computer, they are separated,
3937.68 --> 3946.40:  because a computer is a deterministic, reductionistic structure. Not a cell, not a deeper hospital.
3946.64 --> 3951.44:  But basically you're saying, so when the moment I die, that everything consciousness remains,
3951.44 --> 3957.12:  just this narrow banded avatar like VR headset that expands like...
3957.12 --> 3966.08:  Yeah. Well, basically, I look, I kind of say in the book, Irreducible, I explain this by saying,
3966.08 --> 3973.44:  imagine that you control a drone. We are a body controls a drone. There is in Afghanistan, watching
3973.44 --> 3982.88:  around and semi-autonomous. So I don't have to worry about to... I only have to express where I
3982.88 --> 3989.20:  want it to go. So high level language, say move right or whatever, drop the bomb or whatever,
3989.20 --> 3997.28:  because that's what we do with drones in these days. But anyway, so now the drone looks at that
3998.08 --> 4006.32:  reality where it is, sends me information, and I get the conscious experience of what the drone is
4006.32 --> 4013.84:  seeing. That conscious experience is not in my body, is in my consciousness. And based on that,
4013.84 --> 4018.40:  and based on my free will, I'll tell the drone what to do. The drone doesn't know anything.
4019.92 --> 4026.88:  Now take this image, oh, and when somebody shoots it down, you were so
4027.36 --> 4033.68:  focused on that drone that you only saw what the drone was seeing, because you were piloting it,
4033.68 --> 4039.44:  and you were concentrated. Then when the drone doesn't send you on the scene, you look around,
4039.44 --> 4046.00:  you say, oh my god, there is another world here. You see? Yeah. That's the same thing, the ego,
4046.00 --> 4051.44:  when the body dies, it doesn't look at the signals of the body anymore, and it looks around, oh,
4051.44 --> 4057.84:  shit. Wow, look at this. And is it then, are we sitting there then, say at this level,
4057.84 --> 4062.24:  quantum, say, okay, let's go in again, here's another headset, try this one on, and there we
4062.24 --> 4069.12:  are again, and a baby in it. Perhaps, but I cannot tell you what happens afterwards, but certainly
4069.12 --> 4077.68:  there are lots of near-death experiences that are actually giving you evidence of what I'm saying.
4077.68 --> 4084.00:  People that arrive at the hospital, heart doesn't beat, brain doesn't have any electrical signals,
4084.00 --> 4089.12:  they are clinically dead, they're not dead clearly if they are resuscitated, but they are,
4089.12 --> 4096.00:  for all practical purposes, dead, and they have an experience in the hospital. They see themselves
4097.04 --> 4105.60:  in the operating table, they later tell what's going on, while the brain has no electrical
4105.60 --> 4110.00:  signal, the brain is not functioning, so how can you be outside of the body looking down at your
4110.00 --> 4117.84:  body in the operating table, as cannot be explained, right? But of course now people say, scientists
4117.84 --> 4123.36:  say, oh, it's a fantasy, oh, come on, I mean, it's impossible, so that's it. But that's what they do,
4123.36 --> 4128.48:  then they move outside of the, you know, they move in a different environment, they meet people,
4128.48 --> 4133.92:  you know, their parents that were dead, and friends that were dead. In some cases, they meet a friend
4133.92 --> 4141.20:  that was, that they didn't know that he was dead, then when they woke up, they find out that he died
4141.20 --> 4147.36:  the day before and they didn't know, and they met this person in that reality, vast reality.
4147.36 --> 4153.52:  They have an experience of expansion, of love, and joy, and peace, and then somebody tells him,
4153.52 --> 4157.52:  here to go back, because you haven't done what you were, what you came to this world to do,
4157.52 --> 4161.76:  and then they wake up in the post-operative room. But in that sort of drone metaphor, trying to
4161.76 --> 4167.76:  understand this, I've always, what sort of, what I find hard to understand, okay, so if my body is
4167.76 --> 4173.76:  this drone or avatar or just a headset, then say the moment it dies, what headset are you putting
4173.76 --> 4179.84:  on to have like, just hover around and in this in-between space? Is that another headset or another?
4180.48 --> 4185.44:  That's a good question. I mean, I'm asking that question, and there may be, in fact,
4185.44 --> 4190.24:  this likely that there is another body, I mean, people that have studied this thing,
4190.24 --> 4198.72:  talk about an astral body, or an etheric body, and, you know, so clearly there is another body.
4199.60 --> 4204.08:  If this is true, but I believe it's true, I actually went out of body too, so I know
4204.72 --> 4210.32:  that it's not imagination. You know that you're out of body, like when this energy came out of me,
4210.32 --> 4215.76:  it was energy, it was physical, it was not, you know, it was not imagination, it was physical,
4216.32 --> 4224.72:  like an hydrant. How can I make it up? So there are lots of levels to get to one,
4224.72 --> 4232.16:  there are many in those things. Oh my goodness, I mean, the quantum field of electrons is, in this
4233.12 --> 4240.80:  theory, is conscious and has free will, and he knows itself. Look at the, you know,
4240.88 --> 4245.28:  and then what are the electrons doing? The electrons are the symbols that the
4245.28 --> 4250.64:  quantum field uses to communicate with other fields. All the electrons in the universe,
4250.64 --> 4256.64:  how many electrons are in the universe? 10 to the 82, 83, 85, I don't know, but numbers that are
4256.64 --> 4263.92:  imaginable, you know, unimaginable, just the field of electrons, and all these electrons are its
4263.92 --> 4269.04:  communication to the other fields to know itself. How many quantum fields are there, or can there be?
4269.04 --> 4277.60:  It's 17. Yeah, I'm asking because people, you could also call it quip, right, quantum information,
4277.60 --> 4284.00:  pentpsychism. And pentpsychism is, of course, I know your version of it is different, but it's sort
4284.00 --> 4289.20:  of being criticized for the fact that you have the combination problem, right? Why? Oh, there is no
4289.20 --> 4297.84:  combination problem, the combination problem, only in classical pentpsychism. People never have a
4297.84 --> 4304.80:  theory. Nobody had a theory of quantum pentpsychism. The combination problem is not a problem in
4305.36 --> 4313.28:  quantum pentpsychism. When you combine states, quantum states, you create a new state, which is
4313.28 --> 4318.40:  more than the sum of the parts. You can do that infinitely. You can keep on doing that. You can
4318.40 --> 4324.88:  keep on going. Of course you can. So we have solved that problem. People that say that, they don't
4324.88 --> 4330.96:  understand what they're saying, or they don't understand what we have developed this theory,
4330.96 --> 4336.88:  quantum, you know, the combination problem is solved completely. It's classical pentpsychism
4336.88 --> 4344.56:  that doesn't solve the problem because in classical physics, the whole is only the sum of the parts.
4344.56 --> 4349.36:  You cannot create a whole that is more than the sum of the parts. And that's why I was criticizing
4349.44 --> 4357.68:  emergentism before, because people, many physicists, think that there is emerging properties in the
4357.68 --> 4365.04:  purely classical world. It cannot be. Emergentism requires quantumness. And they don't realize,
4365.04 --> 4370.56:  because there is no boundary between classical and quantum. And so there is a seeping from quantum,
4370.56 --> 4376.16:  you go to classical, and then they call emergent property as if it came from the classical. No,
4376.16 --> 4380.32:  it comes, every creation comes from the quantum world, from the inner world.
4381.36 --> 4387.28:  Is there an endpoint to the universe in the sense that can one, no, you already said that,
4387.28 --> 4391.76:  the moment it knows itself, it splits off again in another part whole. So this will keep on going
4391.76 --> 4401.36:  forever? In this theory, yes. But who knows, right? But certainly there is no, you know,
4401.36 --> 4407.20:  there cannot be any end. And the reason is that, you know that yourself, the more you know,
4407.20 --> 4412.32:  the more there is to know, because to know more, you make connections, new connections.
4412.88 --> 4420.64:  And as you make new connections, you open up, you open up other possibilities. So it is an explosive
4420.64 --> 4430.40:  thing. And in, again, purely, this is hypothetical, but I think they have possible legs. Why is space
4431.04 --> 4439.68:  expanding faster than light at the edges? You know, because it is basically there is ever,
4439.68 --> 4445.04:  you know, space is like a balloon that inflates. And this is the inflation, you know, inflation.
4445.04 --> 4449.28:  Now, the inflation was the early part of the universe. This is not called inflation. This is
4449.28 --> 4454.40:  just the, you know, this is just, this is a consequence of having found that there is the
4454.48 --> 4462.08:  universe is expanding exponentially at the, at the, in the horizon. So, which can only be explained
4462.08 --> 4470.72:  if there is a, the, the, the universe is, is growing, the space is growing from within. Okay.
4471.28 --> 4481.04:  In, in my model, my model, space is the memory of the self-knowing of one. And because one knows
4481.04 --> 4491.28:  ever more about itself, space must inflate, must grow exponentially. And you know that,
4491.28 --> 4500.88:  you know, that quantum states only exist within a very narrow present. So in order to remember
4500.88 --> 4507.52:  your experience, you must put it into long-term memory. That's our theory also is selling that
4507.52 --> 4518.56:  very clearly. So now this present are enriches itself of all the past that you have experience.
4519.84 --> 4526.00:  But when you want to experience that past, you can only experience that in the present. So experience
4526.00 --> 4533.68:  can only exist in the present. Here you, here you and Bernardo can shake hands as well. And
4533.68 --> 4538.96:  then, okay, so free will is fundamental consciousness is and universe wants to know itself.
4539.52 --> 4548.40:  But does it also create a consciousness, a sati in that as a sort of a purpose? Do you think
4548.40 --> 4555.12:  you were born with a certain purpose or sort of that? I think so. Yeah. I think so. And the reason
4555.20 --> 4564.40:  why I am at peace with myself and happy about, you know, my life, what I do is because I know
4564.40 --> 4571.84:  that I'm doing what I came here to do. I know it, you know, because how can I, you know, I wake up
4571.84 --> 4578.72:  with new ideas. Why? You know, but they're all connect, all this stuff that I'm talking to you
4578.72 --> 4583.68:  about, you know, it's like my mind keeps on running around, finding where there are holes,
4583.68 --> 4588.56:  that, you know, understanding is not complete or whatever. You know, why am I doing that?
4590.00 --> 4594.32:  It's beautiful. And what it sort of rings with me is that that that the universe then somehow
4594.88 --> 4601.36:  is thinking to itself, okay, let's look to me because it's one from this different perspective
4601.36 --> 4606.24:  and let's really do that. Let's become Federico. Let's become Hans. Let's become that's right.
4606.24 --> 4610.40:  And really look at ourselves from that perspective and then, you know, but then,
4610.96 --> 4617.92:  then you and I can know each other when enter into resonance by communicating because I cannot
4619.44 --> 4627.52:  directly give you what I'm what I know and what I feel, right? And likewise for you. So we had to
4627.52 --> 4634.56:  communicate and that communication brings into inner resonance. And if we keep on doing that
4634.56 --> 4643.84:  after a while, we if we can create the same state internally, you and I, from that unity of state,
4643.84 --> 4650.80:  then that's like the quantum superposition, then you get a new entity. But then you entity does
4650.80 --> 4658.64:  not destroy who we are. Basically, we we can create another safety like us, like one create,
4658.64 --> 4663.84:  because we have the same properties of one, right? Except one point of view is that of the
4663.84 --> 4670.32:  multiplicity of pointers points of your one. So I create an I can create another another safety,
4670.88 --> 4678.48:  like myself, but not copy myself. So when this when we reach that, you and I create another safety
4678.48 --> 4684.96:  and the two join and they become one, which is with the two points of view joined the two points
4684.96 --> 4691.60:  of your mind and yours, you know, the now become a new combined point of view that now has its own
4691.60 --> 4696.64:  life. And you know, it proceeds and what that takes what that takes is like truly connecting.
4696.64 --> 4701.12:  You said coming becoming into resonance, which is something different than just exchanging classical
4701.12 --> 4706.88:  information. Yeah, that's right. But that resonance means is a new quantum state. We are building a
4706.88 --> 4712.48:  new quantum state, which is the common understanding that common understanding creates a new safety
4713.04 --> 4719.84:  of a higher level. So we create a higher quiescent is. So we are a very high level, but there are
4719.84 --> 4724.24:  still many levels above us. And this is where things can take off because if we look at the world
4724.24 --> 4729.44:  right now at AI, we're talking classical information, we're shutting ourselves off behind screens,
4729.44 --> 4734.32:  sharing classical information with our bits. It's not this information you're talking about.
4734.32 --> 4739.84:  Not at all. Not at all. And besides, we gave that knowledge to the computer.
4741.68 --> 4747.92:  It didn't build it itself. I mean, we gave them the data. We exposed them to that information.
4747.92 --> 4753.68:  Even if it's, oh, in order to do everything by itself. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Tell me about it.
4754.24 --> 4761.76:  It's some bullshit. I mean, and yet it's very useful. So I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm actually happy
4762.24 --> 4769.84:  with if, if AI was used properly, it could speed up our self knowing and everything else very rapidly.
4770.40 --> 4776.24:  But I'm afraid that if we don't change, it will not be used in this form. Yeah. That's all.
4777.92 --> 4786.88:  Thank you so much, Federico. My pleasure. Yeah, it's been a great talk. Amazing. Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
